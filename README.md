This project was part of the course Economic Policy with Dr. Schnetzer.

We did a sort of in-class mini-Hackathon, where we formed groups of 3 and were given the task to create any graph about the current state of the Maastricht Rules within 90 minutes.

Using Eurostat data, my team decided to create a scatter plot for government debt vs. deficit to show where the countries stood in the year 2023. In an in-class vote our team reached the first place.
